# HOMEWORK 04 Part B

The goal of this oart was to create a window where each time you clicked the mouse something changed. All that was to remain was the background color.
---
### PLAN
My idea was to set functions for the color and shape for the code to draw from. Then, I wanted to call those funchtion for the mouse position marked by mousex and mousey.

### EXECUTION
Upon running the code, I see that the mouse click is not working. I got stuff here and intend to return ater asking for help!
